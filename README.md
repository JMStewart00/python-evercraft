### Project Setup

NOTE: We do not do the dice rolling, rolling of the dice "happens".

1. Double check that you have the following extensions installed:
- AREPL for python.
- Python Test Explorer for VSCode

2. Use the PROJECT.md for directions on how to approach the project. Read carefully, at least through the first iteration.

Refer to python documentation for coding standards.

### Project Structure

To start, we will use Python's accepted external testing library, `pytest`, to run tests. There's a directory in tests with an example file already set up for you. 

Test files and directories should begin with `test_` and include a class for tests to run.

Additionally, data models belong in the `evercraft/models` directory.

### Running tests

To run tests we will use the `Python Test Explorer for VSCode` that should now be installed in your gitpod. A new beaker icon on the left bar (above github icon) should now appear in your editor. You should see an example test there already for the test `test_upper`. If your editor is not detecting your tests and allowing you to run all or select tests in your tree, please let us know.
